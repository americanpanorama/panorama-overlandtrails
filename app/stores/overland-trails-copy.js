OverlandTrailsCopy.trails = "<p><strong>Oregon, California, and Utah attracted settlers for different reasons.</strong></p><p>As the availability of farmland declined in the east, men and women were drawn to Oregon's Willamette Valley because of its rich soil. Tens of thousands traveled to California hoping to strike it rich in the gold rush; many of them returned east. The Mormons settled in the Great Basin seeking a refuge where they could practice their religion free from persecution. White settlement in the West was disastrous for Indians everywhere.</p>";

OverlandTrailsCopy.diaristPanel = "<p><strong>Hundred of emigrants kept diaries about their journeys across the plains and mountains.</strong></p><p>While taken as a whole traveling across the continent was, for most emigrants, an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime experience, individual diary entries typically captured mundane if important details: the availability of grass for livestock, the challenges of fording creeks and rivers, the expense of using ferries, the beauty of the sprawling plains or natural wonders like Chimney Rock or Devil's Gate.</p>";

OverlandTrailsCopy.flowMap = "<p>Approximately 250,000 emigrants traveled overland to Oregon and California between 1840 and 1860, and more than 40,000 Mormons to Utah from 1847 to 1860. What began as a tiny trickle to Oregon in 1840 became a stream to the West in a few years and then a flood to California during the Gold Rush years.</p><p><strong>As this flow map indicates, there was no typical year for Overland Trails migrations as the number of people making the journey ebbed and flowed, sometimes dramatically, from year to year.</strong></p>";

OverlandTrailsCopy.mareyChart = "<p><strong>While improvements to the trails and development of new routes reduced the time emigrants needed to travel the Overland Trails, by any account it was a long journey.</strong></p><p>Emigrants to Oregon and California usually embarked on their journey west from the Missouri River in late April or the early weeks of May. On a good day they might travel 15 or 20 miles a day. On bad, they might spend several frustrating days waiting their turn to ferry across a river. For most an exhausting and often tedious journey would take four, five, even six months, ending in September or October.</p>";

OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1840'] = "Joel and Mary Young Walker and their children became the first bona fide settlers to travel overland to Oregon. In the previous two decades only a handful of fur traders and missionaries had made the journey.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1841'] = "More than four times the size of the Walker party but still a tiny group compared to what was to come, the Bidwell-Bartleson party left Missouri for California. The group split, with the majority heading to California, the rest to Oregon.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1842'] = "A large wagon train with more than 100 people traveled to Oregon. News of this migration convinced many that emigration of families over land to the west coast was possible and practical, spurring thousands to traverse the trail in the coming years.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1843'] = "In what was called the \"great migration,\" nearly a thousand emigrants traveled to Oregon, initiating larger annual overland migrations.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1844'] = "The supposedly \"great migration\" of the previous year did not look as great a wagon train of nearly 1,500 departed for Oregon.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1845'] = "The 2,500 emigrants to Oregon nearly doubled the American population there, strengthening the U.S.'s claim to the Oregon Country. That dispute with Britain would be resolved the next year with the boundary set at the 49th parallel.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1846'] = "One of the great tragedies of western migrations befell the Donner Party. After experiencing several delays, they found themselves snowbound in California's Sierra Nevada mountains where 39 of their party perished.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1847'] = "After being driven out of Nauvoo, Illinois, and wintering near the Missouri river, Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young migrated west near the Great Salt Lake. They sought a remote location where they might practice their religion.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1848'] = "The establishment of army posts along the Overland Trails began with the construction of Fort Kearny in central Nebraska. The army played something of a policing role, attempting to ensure peace between Indians and emigrants.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1849'] = "Migration to California exploded. Thousands rushed west after gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill. The U.S. army established a larger presence along the trail, taking over Fort Laramie and established a small camp near Fort Hall.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1850'] = "The number of emigrants travelling overland to California grew substantially. This was the deadliest year on the Overland Trails. Approximately 5,000 people perished along the trails, most from cholera.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1851'] = "As the prospect of finding gold in California waned, fear of death on the trail increased, and torrential rains in the Midwest made an already challenging journey that much more difficult, migrations west plummeted.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1852'] = "Emigration to the West rebounded, substantially. The trails became a crowded highway as more people traveled overland to California, Oregon, and Utah than any year between OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1840 and OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1860";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1853'] = "Gold production had peaked the previous year, and travel overland began a sharp and steady decline.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1854'] = "The Grattan Massacre near Fort Laramie, where 30 US soldiers were killed in a Sioux encampment, emblematized increasingly contentious relations between Indian tribes and white Americans along the trails as migration eroded tribes' sovereignty.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1855'] = "The completion of a railroad across Panama shortened that route from the eastern to the western US. Along with increased hostilities along the trail, this produced a precipitous decline in the number of emigrants along the trails.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1856'] = "Lacking funds to purchase wagons and horses, hundreds of Mormon emigrants from Europe trekked to the Great Basin using handcarts that they pulled themselves. More than 100 died after being caught by snowstorms after departing late in the season.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1857'] = "Disputes between the Mormon leadership and the federal government came to a head. President Buchanan dispatched troops to impose federal authority. Mormon militiamen killed over 100 emigrants to California in the Mountain Meadows Massacre.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1858'] = "The \"Utah War\" was peacefully resolved when the Mormon leadership submitted to federal authority after receiving pardons and assurance that they could practice their religion. The governorship passed to a non-Mormon appointee.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1859'] = "Following the resolution of the \"Utah War,\" travel along the California Trail increased substantially. Oregon was admitted to the Union.";
OverlandTrailsCopy.years['1860'] = "The Pony Express introduced overland mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento. Riders would race across the continent in about 10 days, using fresh horses stabled at more than 150 stations located at intervals of about 10 miles."
